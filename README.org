#+title: Swedish genome portal
#+subtitle: A prototype

This early-stage prototype demonstrates how a genome browser can be
embedded to a static website, and display pre-configured assemblies
and annotation tracks.

Two organisms are used for the puropose of demonstration:
- Aspergillus Nidulans
- Clupea Harengus (Atlantic herring)

A detailed inventory of assemblies and annotation tracks displayed can
be found in [[file:index.org][index.org]].

Data files and browser code are not included in this repository, to
avoid versioning large files and third-party browser releases, but
bootstrap scripts to fetch these elements are goind to be provided.

Once browser code and genomic data are downloaded to the appropriate
locations, launching a web server in the root directory is all that is
needed, e.g.

#+begin_src bash
npx serve 
#+end_src
