## Glossary

There are many specialized terms and concepts used in genomics and bioinformatics. On this page, we have compiled a glossary of some of the scientific terminology used in the Genome Portal to describe data types, methods, and quality metrics.

To facilitate communication, advocate the FAIR principles, and ensure scientific accuracy, the glossary will use terms and definitions from external biological ontologies and controlled vocabularies whenever possible. In particular, we try to use ontologies included in the [Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry](https://obofoundry.org/), which is an open source, non-redudant collection of ontologies.

On the rare occation that a glossary term does not have a definition in any external ontology, we will produce our own definition and include links to the references used to support the definition. If you have any questions or suggestions of new glossary terms, please contact us at [dsn-eb@scilifelab.se](mailto:dsn-eb@scilifelab.se) or through the <a href="/contact">Contact page</a>.
