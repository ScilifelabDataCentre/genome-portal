Notes: Assembly statistics were calculated for the primary genome assembly GCA_946122785.1. Busco statistics were taken from Gutiérrez-Valencia et al. (2022). Annotation statistics were calculated using Ltenue_v1_genes.gff.

BUSCO notation: C: Complete; S: Single-copy; D: Duplicated; F: Fragmented; M: Missing; n: Total BUSCO genes included in the dataset (here: eudicots_odb10). See also [the official BUSCO manual](https://busco.ezlab.org/busco_userguide.html#interpreting-the-results).
