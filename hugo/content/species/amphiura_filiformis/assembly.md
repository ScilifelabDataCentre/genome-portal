Notes: Assembly statistics were calculated for the primary genome assembly GCA_039555335.1. Busco statistics were taken from Parey et al. (2024) and communication with the authors. Annotation statistics were calculated using Afil_fr2py.wn.filt.final.chroms.sorted.gtf.

BUSCO notation: C: Complete; S: Single-copy; D: Duplicated; F: Fragmented; M: Missing; n: Total BUSCO genes included in the dataset (here: arthropoda_odb10). See also [the official BUSCO manual](https://busco.ezlab.org/busco_userguide.html#interpreting-the-results).
