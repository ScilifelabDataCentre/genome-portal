Notes: Assembly statistics were calculated for the primary genome assembly GCA_030871285.1(JATAAI01.fasta.gz) using Quast (v5.2.0; Mikheenko et al. 2018). Busco statistics (Manni et al., 2021) were taken from communication with the authors. Annotation statistics were calculated for GCA_030871285.1_GU_Smar_1.1.8_genomic.gff using AGAT (v1.4.1; Dainat, 2024).

BUSCO notation: C: Complete; S: Single-copy; D: Duplicated; F: Fragmented; M: Missing; n: Total BUSCO genes included in the dataset (here: stramenopiles_odb10). See also [the official BUSCO manual](https://busco.ezlab.org/busco_userguide.html#interpreting-the-results).
