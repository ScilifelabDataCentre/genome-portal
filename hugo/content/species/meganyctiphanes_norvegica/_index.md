### Description

The *Meganyctiphanes norvegica* species of krill is a macrozooplankton crustacean found in the Northen Atlantic (Unneberg et al., 2024). It is among the largest of the Euphausiid (krill) species, with total body length reaching up to 40 and 50 mm (Tarling et al., 2010). It can tolerate a broader range of temperatures than many other krill species (Huenerlage & Buchholz, 2015), and consequently has a large latitudinal distribution ranging from Barents Sea to the Mediterranean Sea (Tarling et al., 2010; Unneberg et al., 2024).

The wide distribution and thermal tolerance of *M. norvegica* make it a powerful model to study ecological adaptation to different marine climates and rapid ocean warming. A challenge with genomic analysis of krill species is their huge genome size (19 Gb for *M. norvegica*) (Choquet et al. 2023; Jeffery, 2012; Unneberg et al., 2024). While most genetic variation appears to be widespread among individuals throughout the range of the species, researchers have also identified many signatures of local genetic adaptations in genes involved in responses to light and temperature (Unneberg et al., 2024). In particular, krill from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea are distinctly different at hundreds of genes. Such genetic variation could be crucial for allowing the krill to adapt to continued climate change and promote reliance of krill populations in a warmer ocean.
