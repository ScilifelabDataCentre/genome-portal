### Description

*Stylops ater* is a West Palearctic species of twisted-winged parasite (Strepsiptera, Stylopidia) which develop endoparasitically in two closely related mining bee species, *Andrena vaga* and *Andrena cineraria*. Like all Stylopidians, *Stylops ater* is characterized by extreme sexual dimorphism with a short-lived winged male and a larviform female that never leaves the host. The minute (around 200 μm) primary host-seeking larva are released in high numbers by the female and must reach a bee nest to enter a new developing host bee. Remaining larval development takes place inside the lumen of a host. Bees parasitized by *Stylops ater* emerge earlier in the spring than non-parasitized individuals (Hoffmann et al 2023). *Stylops ater* also modifies the external morphology of infected bees and impairs the development of ovaries of infected female hosts (Hoffmann et al 2023). Mating takes place on the host by means of traumatic insemination inside a paragenital organ on the female cephalothorax (Peinert et al, 2016). Males are attracted to females by the release of an identified pheromone named Stylopsal (Cvačka et al. 2012). The genome of *Stylops ater* is very small (53.2Mb), with a reduced number (<8000) of densely packed (>100 genes Mb-1) protein coding genes.
