Notes: Assembly statistics were calculated for the primary genome assembly GCA_907164705.1. Busco statistics were taken from Podsiadlowski et al. (2021). Annotation statistics were calculated using GCA_907164705.1_Parnassius_apollo_genomic.gff.gz.

BUSCO notation: C: Complete; S: Single-copy; D: Duplicated; F: Fragmented; M: Missing; n: Total BUSCO genes included in the dataset (here: arthropoda_odb10). See also [the official BUSCO manual](https://busco.ezlab.org/busco_userguide.html#interpreting-the-results).
