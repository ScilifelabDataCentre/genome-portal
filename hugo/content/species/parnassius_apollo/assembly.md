Notes: Assembly statistics were calculated for the primary genome assembly GCA_907164705.1 (CAKOGL01.fasta.gz) using Quast (v5.2.0; Mikheenko et al. 2018). Busco statistics (Manni et al., 2021) were taken from Podsiadlowski et al. (2021). Annotation statistics were calculated using GCA_907164705.1_Parnassius_apollo_genomic.gff.gz using AGAT (v1.4.1; Dainat, 2024).

BUSCO notation: C: Complete; S: Single-copy; D: Duplicated; F: Fragmented; M: Missing; n: Total BUSCO genes included in the dataset (here: arthropoda_odb10). See also [the official BUSCO manual](https://busco.ezlab.org/busco_userguide.html#interpreting-the-results).
