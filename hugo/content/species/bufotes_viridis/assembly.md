Notes: Assembly statistics were calculated for the primary genome assembly GCA_963931945.1 (CAWYQA01.fasta.gz). Busco statistics were taken from Rödin-Mörch et al. (2025). Annotation statistics were calculated using GCA_963931945.1_Bufotes_viridis_n_2023_12_genomic.gff.gz.

BUSCO notation: C: Complete; S: Single-copy; D: Duplicated; F: Fragmented; M: Missing; n: Total BUSCO genes included in the dataset (here: eudicots_odb10). See also [the official BUSCO manual](https://busco.ezlab.org/busco_userguide.html#interpreting-the-results).
