Notes: Assembly statistics were calculated for the primary genome assembly GCA_963668995.1 (CAVLGL01.fasta.gz) using Quast (v5.2.0; Mikheenko et al. 2018). This did not include the mitochondrial assembly (OZ075093.1). Busco statistics (Manni et al., 2021) were taken from Höglund et al. (2024) and communication with the authors. Annotation statistics were calculated for pmne_functional_edit1.gff.gz using AGAT (v1.4.1; Dainat, 2024).

BUSCO notation: C: Complete; S: Single-copy; D: Duplicated; F: Fragmented; M: Missing; n: Total BUSCO genes included in the dataset (here: lepidoptera_odb10). See also [the official BUSCO manual](https://busco.ezlab.org/busco_userguide.html#interpreting-the-results).
