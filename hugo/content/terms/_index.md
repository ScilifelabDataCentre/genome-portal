### Description

By accessing the Swedish Reference Genome Portal website, you agree to the following terms of use and to the <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a>.

This is a public website, so no licence or permission is needed to use it. Additionally, no licence or permission is required to reproduce graphics generated using the embedded genome browser.

While the genomic data displayed on the Genome Portal is freely accessible from public repositories, some other data (e.g., images) may be protected by copyright or other intellectual property rights belonging to third parties. Accessing and using this data is subject to the rights claimed by the data authors, including, but not limited to, Creative Commons licences.

To display a genomic dataset on the Genome Portal, which may include the creation of a 'Species page', certain requirements must be met. You can read about these requirements in the <a href="/contribute">Contribute</a> page.

To temporarily upload and visualise your own data on the genome browser, assuming that the data shares the same genomic coordinates (i.e., it was mapped to the same species genome assembly), please follow the instructions on <a href="/faqs">how to add a data track to the genome browser</a>. Note that once the web browser is closed, the data is lost and must be re-uploaded.

### Disclaimer

The Swedish Reference Genome Portal is intended to offer information for general and scientific purposes, and it is provided “as is”, with the understanding that you use it at your own risk. The data displayed on the Genome Portal is meant for research purposes only.

The Genome Portal staff provides no warranty, guarantee, or assurance regarding the quality, accuracy, completeness, or relevance of the data and information available on the website. The Genome Portal staff disclaims any responsibility for loss or damage resulting from access to or use of the Genome Portal website.

The Genome Portal staff provides links to the source data to help you evaluate the relevance of each dataset for your specific needs. We encourage you to review all data available for a given taxon and examine the metadata to determine whether a dataset is suitable for inclusion and reuse in your studies.

Genomic data attributed to individual species displayed on the Genome Portal comes directly from the source datasets retrieved from public repositories and is not verified by the Genome Portal staff for taxonomic or scientific accuracy. This means that if genomic data is taxonomically misidentified in the original source, it will appear under the same (potentially incorrect) species name on the Genome Portal. The same applies to occurrence data retrieved from external sources such as GBIF and SBDI to build a species occurrence map, as well as to the taxonomic information fetched from ENA, both of which are part of the 'Species page'.

### Using the content

When you use the Swedish Reference Genome Portal website, its source code, the embedded genome browser, or the genomic data files in your work (e.g., publication, web page, presentation), we appreciate that you credit the respective contributor(s) by following the guidelines on the <a href="/citation">Cite us</a> page.

### Changes to the terms of use

We may update our terms of use at any time and without notice. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes.

If you have any questions or suggestions about our terms of use, do not hesitate to contact us via email at [dsn-eb@scilifelab.se](mailto:dsn-eb@scilifelab.se) or via the <a href="/contact">Contact</a> form.
