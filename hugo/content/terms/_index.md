## Description

By accessing the Swedish Reference Genome Portal website, you agree to the Terms of Use here described, and with the [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

Data accessible through the Genome Portal may be protected by copyright.

This is a public website, so no licence or permission is needed to use the site or any data displayed on it, as the data is already available in a public repository. Additionally, no licence or permission is required to reproduce graphics produced by the embedded genome browser. The data displayed on the Genome Portal is meant for research purposes only. 

When you use the Swedish Reference Genome Portal or the source data files in your work (e.g., in a publication, web page, presentation), please credit the respective contributor by following the [citation recommendations](/citation) given here. 

To permanently add and display a dataset in the Genome Portal, which includes the creation of a “Species page”, certain requirements must be met. You can read about the [requirements for adding genome data to the Genome Portal here](/contribute). 

You can also temporarily upload and visualise your own data to an existing genome browser embedded within a “Species page” on the Genome Portal, provided the data shares the same genomic coordinates (i.e., it was mapped to the same species genome assembly). Instructions on [how to add a Data Track in the genome browser can be found here](/user-guide). Note that once the web browser is closed, this data is lost and needs to be re-uploaded.

## Using the Content

## Disclaimer

The Swedish Reference Genome Portal is intended to offer information for general and scientific purposes, and it is provided “as is”, with the understanding that you use it at your own risk.
The Genome Portal staff provides no warranty, guarantee, or assurance regarding the quality, accuracy, completeness, or relevance of the data and information available on the website. The Genome Portal staff expressly disclaims any responsibility for loss or damage resulting from access to or use of the Genome Portal website.

The Genome Portal staff provides links to the source data to help you evaluate the relevance of each dataset for your specific needs. We encourage you to review all data available for a given taxon and examine the metadata to determine whether a dataset is suitable for inclusion and reuse in your studies.

Genomic data attributed to individual species displayed on the Genome Portal comes directly from the source datasets retrieved from public repositories, and is not verified by the Genome Portal staff for taxonomic or scientific accuracy. This means that if genomic data is taxonomically misidentified in the original source, it will appear under the same (potentially incorrect) species name on the Genome Portal. Additionally, data may not show up in searches if it was recorded under an outdated species name. Same applies for occurrence data retrieved from external sources such as GBIF and SBDI, which is used to create the species occurrence map shown in each “Species page”.

**TODO**
>same applies for the taxonomic info that we fetch.

### Changes to the Terms of Use
