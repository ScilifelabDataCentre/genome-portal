title: How to cite the Genome Portal and the data
toc: true
---

In line with the principles of _FAIR_ and _Open Science_, we encourage the reuse and recognition of material made available on the Swedish Reference Genome Portal.
On this page, you will find information about how to cite the portal when reusing and referencing the content.

Depending on how you have interacted with the site, you may want to cite the Genome Portal and the datasets displayed within it in different ways. Sections 1-4 below contain **detailed** instructions for how to cite different aspects of the Genome Portal. If you would instead like to read a **short digest** that do not go into all the details, please see the Summary section found right below.

### Summary

The core of the Swedish Reference Genome Portal is the datasets, and as such the most important part to cite is authors of the data. You will find instructions for how to do this in the "Citation" section on the _Description_ page for each species.

If you have used the Genome Portal to discover and/or work with the data, we would also be happy if you would cite the service as well:

- If you want to cite a specific species entry in the Genome Portal, the easiest way is to use the ready-to-use example found in said "Citation" section for each species. (See also Section 2 below)

- You can also cite the Genome Portal service itself without referring to a specific species entry. This is done by using a simplified version of the citation used for the species entries (see Section 1).

- If you have used the source code for the Genome Portal (which is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/genome-portal/)), we would like you to cite the archived code release in the Zenodo repository. (See Section 4)

You might also want to consider citing the JBrowse 2 genome browser, especially if you have used the genome browser to work with the data. The developers provide their own citation information on the [JBrowse website](https://jbrowse.org/). (See Section 4)

### 1. Citing the Swedish Reference Genome Portal website

To cite the Genome Portal website in general, we ask you to refer to our Research Resource Identifier (**RRID**). RRIDs are persistent and unique identifiers that aim to promote the identification, discovery, and reuse of research resources. For more information, please see the [official RRID Initiative website](https://www.rrids.org/).

The RRID for the Swedish Reference Genome Portal is [**XXXXXX**](https://XXXXXX).

By citing the portal using the RRID, you will facilitate further reuse of the portal, enable us to track that activity, and allow others to easily find the _Summary Report_
for usage of the Swedish Reference Genome Portal. Please use the following when citing the Genome Portal website itself:

**In-text citation (APA format)**:\
Swedish Reference Genome Portal (SciLifeLab Data Centre; _version number_; RRID: XXXXXX).

**Reference list (APA format)**:\
Swedish Reference Genome Portal (_access date_), SciLifeLab Data Centre. Version _version number_. <https://genomes.scilifelab.se>, RRID:XXXXXX.

Please note that the information on the portal is updated continuously, and therefore we ask you to specify the version number of the Genome Portal and the date you accessed it in the citation. You will find the version number of the portal at the bottom of the footer on any page, or on our
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/genome-portal/">GitHub repository</a> under 'releases'.

### 2. Citing a specific species entry

#### A ready-to-use citation is provided for each entry

The easiest way to find the citation information for a species entry in the Genome Portal is to go to the associated _Description_ page.
There you will find a ready-to-use text containing the Genome Portal citation (from Section 1), the species name, and a
DOI pointing to its associated species record in the [SciLifeLab Data Repository](https://figshare.scilifelab.se/).

The general pattern for citing a species entry can also be filled out using the following template:

**In-text citation (APA format)**:\
The [_Species name_] entry in the Swedish Reference Genome Portal (SciLifeLab Data Centre; _version number_; RRID: XXXXXX; [DOI]).

**Reference list (APA format)**:\
Swedish Reference Genome Portal, [_Species name_] entry (_access date_). SciLifeLab Data Centre. Version _version number_. <https://genomes.scilifelab.se/[species_name>], RRID:XXXXXX. [DOI].

where `[species_name]` should be replaced with the binomal name of your species in lower case letters and an underscore, and `[DOI]` with the DOI of the associated metadata in SciLifeLab Data Repository.

#### Data availability statement for submitting researchers

Researchers who have submitted their data to the Genome Portal may want to include the following text for the Data Availability statement in their research manuscript(s).

"Visualisations of the genome assemby and annotation tracks from this publication can be found in the Swedish Reference Genome Portal at <https://genomes.scilifelab.se/[species_name]>.
The accompanying metadata for this entry in the portal can be found at [DOI]."

where `[species_name]` and `[DOI]` should be replaced as described above.

### 3. Citing the data in the portal

Giving proper credit to the authors of the data is central to the principles of _FAIR_ and _Open Science_. Therefore, if you have used any data displayed on the Genome Portal
(genome assemblies and annotation tracks) for your own work, we kindly ask you to cite the data in addition to citing the Swedish Reference Genome Portal (Section 1-2).

All datasets included in the Genome Portal are public, but the means as to how to cite them can vary from dataset to dataset. Instructions for how to cite each dataset is found on
the _Description_ page of each species. In general, many datasets in the Swedish Reference Genome Portal have been published as part of a research article and for those cases,
we reccomend that you cite the original publication. For datasets that do not have an associated publication, please go to the _Download_ page for the species, click the *Show reduced table view*
button and use the accession number or DOI to refer to the dataset.

### 4. Citing the source code

#### Citing the Genome Portal code

The Genome Portal is operated by the <a target="_blank" href="https://scilifelab.se/data">SciLifeLab Data Centre</a> and partners. All of the source code used to generate the website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/genome-portal/).
The code is published under the MIT license. If you have reused the code or otherwise want to cite the code, please use the following:

**APA format:**\
SciLifeLab Data Centre (_year_). genome-portal. Version: _version number_ [Software]. Zenodo. [XXXXXX](https://zenodo.org/doi/TODO).

#### Citing the JBrowse 2 genome browser

The Swedish Reference Genome Portal uses the JBrowse 2 genome browser for interactive visualization of genome assemblies and their associated annotation tracks.
The latest citation instructions can be found at [https://jbrowse.org/](https://jbrowse.org/). At the time of writing, the JBrowse developers ask users to cite the following publication:

**APA format:**\
Diesh, C., Stevens, G. J., Xie, P., De Jesus Martinez, T., Hershberg, E. A., Leung, A., Guo, E., Dider, S., Zhang, J., Bridge, C., Hogue, G., Duncan, A., Morgan, M., Flores, T., Bimber, B. N., Haw, R., Cain, S., Buels, R. M., Stein, L. D., & Holmes, I. H. (2023). JBrowse 2: A modular genome browser with views of synteny and structural variation. Genome Biology, 24(1), 74.
