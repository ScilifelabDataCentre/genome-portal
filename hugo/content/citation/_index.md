title: How to cite the Genome Portal and the data
toc: true
---

In line with the principles of _FAIR_ and _Open Science_, we encourage the reuse and recognition of material made available on the Swedish Reference Genome Portal.

On this page, you will find information about how to cite the Genome Portal and its source code ([Section 1](#1-citing-the-genome-portal-and-specific-species-entries)), the specific datasets from each species ([Section 2](#2-citing-the-data-in-the-portal)), and the JBrowse 2 genome browser ([Section 3](#3-citing-the-jbrowse-2-genome-browser)).

### 1. Citing the Genome Portal and specific species entries

#### Citing the website and the source code

To cite the Swedish Reference Genome Portal, please use the following:

**APA format**:\
Swedish Reference Genome Portal ([access date YYYY-MM-DD]), SciLifeLab Data Centre, version ([version number]) from <https://www.genomes.scilifelab.se>. RRID:XXXXXX.

Since the information on the portal is updated continuously,  we ask you to specify the version number of the Genome Portal and the date you accessed it in the citation by replacing the [access date YYYY-MM-DD] and [version number] placeholders. You will find the version number of the portal at the bottom of the footer on any page, or on our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/genome-portal/">GitHub repository</a> under 'releases'.

#### Citing a specific species entry

You can also cite a specific species entry from the Genome Portal. The easiest way to find the citation information for a species entry is to go to its _Description_ page and copy the citation text. If you have used the data from a species entry in your own work, please also consider citing the authors of the data ([Section 2](#2-citing-the-data-in-the-portal)).

The general pattern for citing a species entry can also be filled out using the following template:

**In-text citation (APA format)**:\
The [_Species name_] entry in the Swedish Reference Genome Portal ([access date YYYY-MM-DD]).

where [_Species name_] is a placeholder that should be replaced with the binomal name of your species in italics, and Swedish Reference Genome Portal ([access date YYYY-MM-DD]) is the APA formatted in-text pointer to the reference stated above in the [Citing the website and the source code](#citing-the-website-and-the-source-code) section.

#### Data availability statement for submitting researchers

Researchers who have submitted their data to the Genome Portal may want to include the following text in the Data Availability statement in their research manuscript(s).

"Visualisations of the genome assemby and annotation tracks from this publication can be found in the Swedish Reference Genome Portal ([access date YYYY-MM-DD]) at <https://genomes.scilifelab.se/[species_name]>."

where [species_name] should be replaced with the binomal name of your species in lower case letters and an underscore, and Swedish Reference Genome Portal ([access date YYYY-MM-DD]) is the APA formatted in-text pointer to the reference stated above in the [Citing the website and the source code](#citing-the-website-and-the-source-code) section.

#### Citing the source code

The Genome Portal is operated by the <a target="_blank" href="https://scilifelab.se/data">SciLifeLab Data Centre</a> and partners. All of the source code used to generate the website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/genome-portal/). The code is published under the MIT license. If you have reused the code or otherwise want to cite the code, please use the following:

**APA format:**\
SciLifeLab Data Centre ([year]). genome-portal. Version: [version number] [Software]. Zenodo. <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXX>.

where [year] and [version number] are placeholders for the year and version number of the code release you want to cite. This information can for instance be found on our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/genome-portal/">GitHub repository</a> or in our <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXX">Zenodo record</a>.

### 2. Citing the data in the portal

Giving proper credit to the authors of the data is central to the principles of _FAIR_ and _Open Science_. Therefore, if you have used any data displayed on the Genome Portal
(genome assemblies and annotation tracks) in your own work, we kindly ask you to cite the data.

All datasets included in the Genome Portal are public, but the means as to how to cite them can vary from dataset to dataset. Instructions for how to cite each dataset is found on the _Description_ page of each species. In general, many datasets in the Swedish Reference Genome Portal have been published as part of a research article and for those cases, we reccomend that you cite the original publication. For datasets that do not have an associated publication, please go to the _Download_ page for the species, click the _Show reduced table view_ button and use the accession number or DOI to refer to the dataset.

### 3. Citing the JBrowse 2 genome browser

You might also want to consider citing the JBrowse 2 genome browser, especially if you have used the genome browser to work with the data. The developers provide their own citation information on the [JBrowse website](https://jbrowse.org/). At the time of writing, the JBrowse developers ask users to cite the following publication:

**APA format:**\
Diesh, C., Stevens, G. J., Xie, P., De Jesus Martinez, T., Hershberg, E. A., Leung, A., Guo, E., Dider, S., Zhang, J., Bridge, C., Hogue, G., Duncan, A., Morgan, M., Flores, T., Bimber, B. N., Haw, R., Cain, S., Buels, R. M., Stein, L. D., & Holmes, I. H. (2023). JBrowse 2: A modular genome browser with views of synteny and structural variation. Genome Biology, 24(1), 74. [https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-023-02914-z](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-023-02914-z)
