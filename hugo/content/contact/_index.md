We welcome all questions and suggestions regarding the genome portal. Please feel free to send an email to the team behind the portal at [dsn-eb@scilifelab.se](mailto:dsn-eb@scilifelab.se) or fill in the contact form below and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

If you would like to get in contact due to an issue with the website and have a GitHub account you are also very welcome to [create an issue on the projects repository](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/swedgene/issues/new), but it is of course fine to use our email or the form below.
