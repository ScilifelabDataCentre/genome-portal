Are you a researcher affiliated with a Swedish research institution and have a genome with annotation tracks you would like to see displayed in the Genome Portal? Great! Please send us a mail at [dsn-eb@scilifelab.se](mailto:dsn-eb@scilifelab.se) or through the <a href="/contact">Contact page</a>. We will be happy to hear about your data and discuss how we can accommodate it.

On this page, we have collected requirements and recommendations for researchers that want to add their species to the Genome Portal.

## Scope and requirements

The Genome Portal displays genomes and associated data tracks that have been produced by researchers in Sweden. We especially encourage researchers to display data types that might otherwise not be shared via the main nucleotide repositories, such as annotations of genomic features other than protein-coding genes, and transcriptome assembly alignments. For more details about the scope of the Genome Portal, please see the <a href="/about" target="_blank">About page</a>.

For a species dataset to be included in the Genome Portal, it needs to fulfill the following requirements:

Please note that the requirements might be subject to change in the future
{{< /info_block >}}

1. The genome needs to have been co-authored by **researchers affiliated to a Swedish research institution**. Note that the organism itself does not need occur naturally in Sweden.

2. **No human data** is allowed in the Genome Portal. This is due to the sensitive nature of human-related data and the legal and ethical concerns about personally identifiable genetic data.

3. For a new species to be considered for inclusion in the Genome Portal, it needs **at a minimum to have a genome assembly** (in FASTA format) **and an annotation of the protein-coding genes** (in GFF file format).

4. All data that is displayed in the Genome Portal needs to be **publicly available in external repositories** (such as ENA, NCBI, Figshare, Zenodo, etc.). No data is hosted on the Genome Portal itself. Our recommendations for how to share data can be found below.

## Recommendations

The Genome Portal is able to display many data types that are commonly used in genomics and transcriptomics studies. In the two sub-pages below we have collected recommendations about file formats and how to upload data files to public repositories. Following these will help in the process of assuring that the data is compatible for display in the Genome Portal.
