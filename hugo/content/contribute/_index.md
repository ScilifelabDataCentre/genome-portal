Are you a researcher affiliated with a Swedish institution who has genome data that you would like to see displayed on the Swedish Reference Genome Portal? Great! Please send us an email to [dsn-eb@scilifelab.se](mailto:dsn-eb@scilifelab.se) or contact us through the <a href="/contact" target="_blank">Contact</a> page. We would be happy to hear about your data and discuss how we can accommodate it.

On this page, we have collected requirements and recommendations for researchers that want to add their data to the Genome Portal.

### Scope

The Swedish Reference Genome Portal is a free national data service for aggregating, discovering, and visualising non-human eukaryotic genome assemblies and genome annotations (co-)produced by researchers with affiliation to a Swedish institution.

We especially encourage researchers to display data types that might otherwise not be shared via the main nucleotide repositories, such as annotations of genomic features other than protein-coding genes (e.g., repeats, conservation scores, transcripts, CpG islands, genetic variants, genetic diversity). For more details about the aims of the Genome Portal, please see <a href="/about" target="_blank">About</a> page.

### Requirements

For a species dataset to be included in the Genome Portal, it needs to fulfil the following requirements:

1. The genome assembly or genome annotation data is (co-)produced by **researchers with affiliation to a Swedish institution**. Note that the species itself does not need to occur naturally in Sweden.

2. The Genome Portal is for **non-human eukaryotic species**.

3. The **species has a genome assembly** in FASTA file format and an **annotation of the protein-coding genes**, preferably in GFF format.

4. The **data is available in public repositories**. Example repositories include the European Nucleotide Archive - ENA, National Center of Biotechnology Information - NCBI, SciLifeLab Data Repository, Zenodo, among others.

We can also accept data under embargo expected to become available after the manuscript under review is approved for publication. The data should be deposited in a public repository and have a reserved DOI and/or accession number. This allows you to indicate in the Data Availability Statement of your manuscript that your data can be visualised on the Genome Portal.

Planning is key! Reach out to us via email at <dsn-eb@scilifelab.se> or through the <a href="/contact" target="_blank">Contact</a> form as soon as you wish to start this process.

*Please note that these requirements may be subject to change at any time and without notice, so we recommend checking them regularly*.

### Supported formats and recommendations for making data public

The Genome Portal staff can help you reserve an entry on the portal already during the manuscript writing stage and provide a reference to the entry that can be used in the Data Availability statement of the manuscript. If you desire, we will wait to activate the entry until the manuscript is accepted for publication and the data has been made public.

## Recommendations

The Genome Portal displays various data types commonly used in genomics studies. The links below provide information on supported data file formats and recommendations for sharing genomic data via public repositories. Following these guidelines will help ensure data compatibility for display on the Genome Portal.
