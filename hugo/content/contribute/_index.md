Are you a researcher affiliated with a Swedish institution and have data that you would like to see displayed on the Swedish Reference Genome Portal? Great! Please send us an email to [dsn-eb@scilifelab.se](mailto:dsn-eb@scilifelab.se) or contact us through the <a href="/contact">Contact page</a>. We will be happy to hear about your data and discuss how we can accommodate it.

On this page, we have collected requirements and recommendations for researchers that want to add their data to the Genome Portal.

## Scope

The Swedish Reference Genome Portal is a free service for aggregating, discovering, and visualising non-human eukaryotic genome assemblies and genome annotations (co-)produced by researchers with affiliation to a Swedish institution. We especially encourage researchers to display data types that might otherwise not be shared via the main nucleotide repositories, such as annotations of genomic features other than protein-coding genes (e.g., repeats, conservation scores, transcripts, CpG islands, genetic variants, genetic diversity). For more details about the aims of the Genome Portal, please see [the About page](/about).

For a species dataset to be included in the Genome Portal, it needs to fulfil the following requirements:

{{< info_block >}}
Please note that the requirements might be subject to change in the future
{{< /info_block >}}

1. The genome assembly or genome annotation data is (co-)produced by **researchers with affiliation to a Swedish institution**. Note that the species itself does not need to occur naturally in Sweden.

2. The Genome Portal is for **non-human eukaryotic species**.

3. The **species has a genome assembly** and an **annotation of the protein-coding genes**.

4. The **data is available in public repositories**. Example repositories include the European Nucleotide Archive - ENA, National Center of Biotechnology Information - NCBI, SciLifeLab Data Repository, Zenodo, among others.

## Recommendations

The Genome Portal is able to display diverse data types that are commonly used in genomics studies. Below, you can find recommendations about which data file formats to use, and how to upload data files to public repositories. Following these recommendations will help in the process of assuring that the data is compatible for display on the Genome Portal.
