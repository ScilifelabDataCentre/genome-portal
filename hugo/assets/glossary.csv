assembly level - chromosome|[FBcv:0003235](https://flybase.org/cgi-bin/cvreport.pl?rel=is_a&id=FBcv:0003235)|There is sequence for one or more chromosomes. This could be a completely sequenced chromosome without gaps or a chromosome containing scaffolds or contigs with gaps between them. There may also be unplaced or unlocalized scaffolds.
assembly level - scaffold|[FBcv:0003236](https://flybase.org/cgi-bin/cvreport.pl?rel=is_a&id=FBcv:0003236)|Some sequence contigs have been connected across gaps to create scaffolds, but no scaffolds have been placed on chromosomes.
