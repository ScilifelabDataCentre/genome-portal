To view your changes as they will appear in the final website, you need to install Hugo.
You can find instructions on the Hugo website: [https://gohugo.io/](https://gohugo.io/)

If you're using Mac OSX, it's recommended to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) -
if homebrew is already set up, installing Hugo is just a case of:

```bash
brew install hugo
```

Once Hugo is installed, simply run the following command in the Hugo project root directory:

```console
$ hugo serve
Start building sites â€¦
hugo v0.128.3+extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate=unknown
