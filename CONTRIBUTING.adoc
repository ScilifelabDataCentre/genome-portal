This guide describes how to submit a new species for the
https://genomes.scilifelab.se[Swedish Reference Genome Portal]

In the following examples, we will assume that you (Github user
`insidethebox`) want to add the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_boxfish[Yellow boxfish]
(described as _Ostracion cubicum_ by Linn√© in 1758) species to the
Genome Portal.

== Prerequisites

Start by
https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository[forking]
the
https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/genome-portal/fork[genome-portal]
repository from your Github account.

Clone the repository to your computer, and create a branch to work on. Name the
branch after the scientific name of the species:

```
git clone git@github.com:insidethebox/genome-portal.git
cd genome-portal
git checkout -b ostracion-cubicum
```

== Reference genome and gene annotation

The first elements we ask you to provide are a reference assembly and
a genome annotation.

Create a file named `config.yml` using the following model:

```yaml
assembly:
  name: yellow_boxfish_assembly
  displayName: "Yellow boxfish genome assembly"
  # The following URL points to the public repository hosting the assembly
  url: "https://example.com/repository/GCA_255255000.fasta.gz"
  fileName: GCA_255255000.fasta.gz
tracks:
  - name: "Protein coding genes"
    # Ditto
    url: "https://example.com/repository/GCA_255255000.gff.gz"
    fileName: GCA_255255000.gff.gz
```

Within the `genome-portal` repository, place this file its own
directory under `config/`, named after the species scientific name:

```
cd genome-portal
mkdir config/ostracion_cubicum
mv config.yml config/ostracion_cubicum
```

Commit and push your changes

```
git commit -am "Base configuration for Ostracion cubicum"
git push origin ostracion-cubicum
```

== Open a pull request

Now to start the onboarding process, create a
https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request[pull
request]. (We encourage you to tick the option allowing us to
https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork[make
changes], for the ease of collaboration)

In the pull request description, tell us a few words about yourself and
your academic involvement with the proposed species.

That's it for a start: we will be notified and guide you through the
next steps in the pull request discussion.
