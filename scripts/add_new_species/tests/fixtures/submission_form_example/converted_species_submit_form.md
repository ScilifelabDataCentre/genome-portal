- Sections 1-3: Provide information on the study and the species.
- Section 4: Download and complete the [Data Tracks
  Form](https://nextcloud.dc.scilifelab.se/s/sof3AJxDMAdYzXG) to provide
  information that will be displayed in the genome browser.

Submission steps:

1.  Fill out the **Species Submission Form** (this Word file).
2.  Complete the **Data Tracks Form** (linked Excel file).
3.  Provide a species photo (see the Annex at the end of this document
    for recommendations).** **
4.  **Send all three files via** **email**
    to:Â [dsn-eb@scilifelab.se](http://dsn-eb@scilifelab.se/), including
    the species name in the email subject or body.

Thanks! Tack sÃ¥ mycket!

# 2. Species information

  ------------------------ --
  Scientific name:   Squirrelus maximus
  English (common) name:  A common squirrel
  ------------------------ --

### Species description

Provide a brief description (max. 200 words) description of the source
species of the genome data. Focus on key characteristics relevant to the
genome project (e.g., biology, ecology, range). Use in-text citations as
needed, following the [APA 7](https://apastyle.apa.org/) format.

- Italicize species scientific names using asterisks (e.g., \*Homo
  sapiens\*).
- Need help? If you do not have a species description, type "**need
  assistance with species description**" in the grey text box below and
  we will get back to you.

This is the species description here. The species is called *Homo sapiens*.

I added a blank line here.

#### References

(If applicable) List the references corresponding to the in-text
citations in the Description section, following the [APA
7](https://apastyle.apa.org/) format.

- Separate each reference with a new line.
- Italicize species scientific names using asterisks (e.g., \*Homo
  sapiens\*).


Referance 1
Referance 2
Referance 3

# 3. Genome assembly information

### Publication

(If applicable) Provide the reference of the scientific article
reporting the genome assembly, following the [APA
7](https://apastyle.apa.org/) format. The article should describe the
source material, methods, and analyses used in generating the genome
assembly.

- Italicize species scientific names using asterisks (e.g., \*Homo
  sapiens\*).

THIS IS THE PUBLICATION

### Funding

List the funding source(s) for the genome assembly and annotation
tracks, using a new line for each. Include grant numbers when
applicable.

The European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement no. [757451](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/757451))
The Swedish Research Council (grant no. 2019-04452)
The Erik Philip-SÃ¶rensen foundation
The BergstrÃ¶ms foundation
The Carl Trygger foundation
The Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation as part of the National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden at SciLifeLab.

# 4. Data Tracks Form

Download the [Data Tracks
Form](https://nextcloud.dc.scilifelab.se/s/sof3AJxDMAdYzXG) (Excel
format) and provide as much information as possible about the data files
you wish to display on the genome browser, even if they are unpublished.
This information will allow us retrieve files from public repositories
and customize data tracks in the genome browser. Refer to the
"Instructions and table example" tab in the spreadsheet for guidelines
and a prefilled example table.

For support on submitting data to public repositories, see the
"Recommendations for unpublished data files" in the Annex.

# Annex

### Recommendations for unpublished data files

All genome data displayed on the Genome Portal must be publicly
available in a repository at the time of deployment. However, we can
begin building a private webpage for your species while the data is
under embargo (e.g., associated with an article under review), or in the
process of being made public in a repository. For this, we require that
you provide the reserved [Digital Object Identifier
(DOI)](https://www.doi.org/) for the data files.

**NOTE:** The private species page will be publicly available only after
the data files are published.

Publishing recommendations for specific data types

- **Genome assembly and protein-coding genes (compulsory):** These files
  are the minimum requirements to create a species webpage and must be
  publicly available in a domain-specific repository (e.g., ENA, or
  NCBI)

  - For ENA submission assistance, contact the [National Bioinformatics
    Infrastructure Sweden,
    NBIS](https://nbis.se/services/data-management-support/apply).

- **Annotation data tracks (optional but highly recommended):** These
  include F~ST~, Tajima's D, nucleotide diversity, repeat regions,
  conserved elements, methylated regions, and other genomic features or
  metrics sharing the same coordinates as the reference genome assembly.

  - We offer free assistance for submitting annotation data to the
    [SciLifeLab Data
    Repository](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/repository/). To request
    help, type "need assistance" in the "link_to_repository" column of
    the Data Track Form.
  - Variant Call Format (VCF) files should be submitted to the [European
    Variation Archive (EVA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/). For
    assistance, contact the
    [NBIS](https://nbis.se/services/data-management-support/apply).

**NOTE:** If you request to build a private species page while your data
is being submitted for publication, we can provide you a web address
(URL) for inclusion in the repository or in the scientific articles'
Data Availability Statement. For citation instructions, see the [*Cite
us page*](https://genomes.scilifelab.se/cite_us/).

### Recommendations for species photo

Please provide an image of the source species associated with the genome
data.

- **Preferred image aspect ratio:** 4:3 (if different, we can adjust it
  accordingly).

<!-- -->

- **Image source and licensing:**

  - If applicable, indicate the [creative common
    license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/) of
    the photo (e.g., Tangara seledon by Gloria Fuentes, CC BY-SA 3.0)
  - If using a photo with permission, credit the author(s) (e.g.,
    Pyrocephalus rubinusÂ by Humberto Alvarez, used with permission).
